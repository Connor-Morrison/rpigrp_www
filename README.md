A minimal prototype for a Flask-based website.

Requires [python3](https://www.python.org/) and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).

To run from a shell use `python3 path/to/app.py` and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in a browser.

As a first prototype it is meant to be improved and adapted. Images were designed and can be modified with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org.) Python, HTML, and CSS can be modified with any decent code editor.

It was put together for a small group of Makers who are learning web (and other) technologies via workshops and projects.
